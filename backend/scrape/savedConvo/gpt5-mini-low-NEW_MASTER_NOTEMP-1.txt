MATH 285 fulfills the linear algebra component.\n- Statistics requirement: STAT 190 (Fall 2026) satisfies both Statistics Perspective and the minor/stat requirement.\n- Lab science: BIOL 107 (Spring 2027) fulfills the STEM lab science requirement.\n- Arts & Humanities: PHRE 186 (in-progress Spring 2026) plus ENG 211 and ART 203 cover the 9 credits from two different prefixes.\n- Communication Skills: ENG 190 (Spring 2026) fulfills Writing as Critical Thinking; plan to take a Speaking course (COMM 170) if you prefer an alternate speaking option in a future semester if needed.\n\nSemester-by-semester summary (key courses only):\n- Fall 2025 (approx. 16 cr): TRU 120, CS 100, CS 180, MATH 198, SPAN 101\n- Spring 2026 (approx. 16 cr): CS 181, CS 191, MATH 263, PHRE 186, ENG 190\n- Fall 2026 (approx. 15 cr): CS 250, CS 260, CS 291, STAT 190, SPAN 102\n- Spring 2027 (approx. 16 cr): CS 310, CS 330, DATA 222, BIOL 107 (lab), JINS 300\n- Fall 2027 (approx. 15 cr): CS 315, CS 345, DATA 324, POL 161, ENG 211\n- Spring 2028 (approx. 15 cr): CS 370, CS 390, CS 430, MATH 285, SOAN 190\n- Fall 2028 (approx. 16 cr): CS 495, CS 455, CS 460, ART 203 (plus fill to target credits with electives as needed)\n- Spring 2029 (approx. 15-16 cr): CS 497 (capstone), CS 480, CS 325, PHYS 195, PSYC 166 (or other elective to meet remaining credits)\n\nHow this gets you to graduation:\n- The plan completes the CS core sequence, major electives, capstone, Data Science minor requirements, the STEM lab, Statistics perspective, Communication Skills, Arts & Humanities, Social Perspective (two prefixes), and the JINS WE requirement.\n- It front-loads general education and minor requirements so the final semesters focus on capstone and upper-level CS electives.\n\nAction items (next steps):\n1) Review this plan with your academic advisor to confirm course availability and semester offerings (some CS electives may rotate by year).\n2) If you prefer a different area elective (Area A/B/C), swap CS 315/390/480 with another listed elective that fits prerequisites and your interests.\n3) Monitor GPA requirements for major (2.0) and minor (2.5) as you progress; adjust courses if repeats or substitutions are needed.\n\nIf you want, I can convert this into a credit-counted per-semester grid (exact credits per course and totals) or adjust the plan to prioritize internships, research, or a different elective focus (AI, security, or databases)."}
