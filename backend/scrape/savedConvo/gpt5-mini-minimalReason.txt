Remaining credits to reach 120: 89. Estimated semesters needed at 15 credits/term: 6 (rounded up), planning to complete across 8-semester four-year plan with current progress. You are a freshman-level student with many first-year courses already in-progress (TRU 120, CS100, CS180, MATH198 in Fall 2025). This plan follows the Truman CS BS sample plan strictly, replaces all placeholders with specific courses, and verifies prerequisite sequencing.\n\nAssumptions and rules applied:\n- Sample plan from Truman used as primary sequencing source.\n- All placeholders replaced with specific courses available in catalog (examples: PHYS 195 for lab science; ART or ARTS 200 as AH elective; HIST 101 for Social Perspective/Missouri Statute — student should select a section with MO attribute if needed).\n- Each recommended course respects prerequisite sequencing: CS 180 -> CS 181/191 -> CS 260 -> CS 310 -> upper-level CS courses -> CS 495/497 capstone.\n- Prioritize completing Communication Skills (ENG 190 + COMM 170), Statistics (STAT 190/290), Lab Science, Arts & Humanities, Social Perspective, JINS, and required support (MATH 263/264, MATH 285 if taking linear algebra option for minor).\n- Balance to reach ~120 credits: DegreeWorks shows 31 applied; planned courses below add sufficient credits across remaining semesters to reach ~120 (student to verify seat availability and term offerings).\n\nSemester-by-semester recommended sequencing (start point: Fall Year 1 already in-progress — plan resumes from Spring Year 1 onward and through 8 semesters):\n\nFall Year 1 (already in progress per audit — totals shown):\n- TRU 120 (3) — in-progress\n- CS 100 (1) — in-progress\n- CS 180 (4) — in-progress\n- MATH 198 (5) — in-progress\n- COMM 170 (3) — add this to meet Speaking requirement\nTerm credits (planned/in-progress): 16\nNotes: This matches sample plan; Communication Skills (Speaking) satisfied by COMM 170.\n\nSpring Year 1 (sample plan semester 2) — courses to take:\n- CS 181 (3) — in-progress per audit\n- CS 191 (3) — in-progress per audit\n- MATH 263 (4) — in-progress per audit\n- PHRE 186 (3) — in-progress per audit (counts toward Arts & Humanities)\n- ENG 190 (3) — add Writing as Critical Thinking\nTerm credits: 16\nPrereq checks: CS 181/191 require CS180 (in-progress). MATH 263 follows MATH198.\n\nFall Year 2 (sample plan Fall Year 2) — courses to take:\n- CS 260 (3) — OOP & Design (prereq: CS180/181)\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation (prereq: CS181/191)\n- MATH 264 (4) — Calculus III (prereq: MATH263)\n- STAT 190 (3) — Statistics for Natural Sciences (fulfills Statistics Perspective)\n- ARTS 200 (3) — Arts & Humanities elective (replace placeholder)\nTerm credits: 16\nNotes: STAT 190 assists Data Science minor. Ensure MATH 264 aligns with BS support requirement.\n\nSpring Year 2 (sample plan Spring Year 2) — courses to take:\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures & Algorithms (prereq: CS260/191)\n- CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (Area A elective)\n- CS 333 (4) — Computer Systems Architecture (in DegreeWorks listing)\n- PHYS 195 (4) — Lab Science with lab (fulfills STEM lab requirement)\n- HIST 101 (3) — Social Perspective / Missouri Statute (choose section with MO attribute)\nTerm credits: 17\nPrereq checks: CS310 requires CS260 and CS191; CS333 requires CS191 and/or CS260.\n\nFall Year 3 (sample plan Fall Year 3) — courses to take:\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (WE)\n- CS 370 (3) — Software Engineering (WE)\n- CS 325 (3) — General CS elective 300+ (supports Data Science interests)\n- Upper-level elective (e.g., MATH 285 if pursuing linear algebra for minor) (3)\n- Social elective (3) — additional Social Perspective course from different prefix than HIST\nTerm credits: 15\nNotes: Ensure upper-level elective choice satisfies BS upper-level credit requirements and minor prerequisites if taking MATH 285.\n\nSpring Year 3 (sample plan Spring Year 3) — courses to take:\n- CS 390 (3) — Systems elective (Operating Systems) (Area B)\n- CS elective 300+ (e.g., CS 480: Artificial Intelligence) (3)\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (minor requirement)\n- DATA 324 (3) — Data Visualization (minor requirement option)\n- Upper-level elective (3) — counts toward 40 upper-level credits\nTerm credits: 15\nPrereq checks: CS390 requires CS333/310; DATA222 requires STAT/CS foundations.\n\nFall Year 4 (sample plan Fall Year 4) — courses to take:\n- CS 430 (3) — Database Systems (CS option for minor) (prereq: CS260/310)\n- CS elective 300+ (3)\n- CS elective 300+ (3)\n- Upper-level elective 300+ (3)\n- JINS 3XX (1) — Junior Interdisciplinary Seminar (Writing Enhanced) — note: sample plan lists JINS in Year 4 Fall; ensure you take WE requirement\nTerm credits: 13 (note: JINS is 1 credit per sample; consider adding a 2-credit elective or another 3-credit upper-level elective to reach 15 credits)\nAdjustment: Add one additional upper-level elective (3) to bring credits to 16.\n\nSpring Year 4 (sample plan Spring Year 4) — courses to take:\n- CS 495 (1) — Senior Computer Science Seminar\n- CS 497 (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience\n- Upper-level elective (3)\n- Upper-level elective (3)\n- Free elective (3)\nTerm credits: 13\nAdjustment: Add one additional 2-credit/3-credit elective or reorganize prior semester to ensure each semester is 15-17 credits; target Spring Year 4 = 15-16 credits by adding a 2-3 credit upper-level elective.\n\nCredits and graduation checks:\n- Applied credits from DegreeWorks: 31\n- Planned additional credits across remaining semesters (approx):\n  Fall Y1: 16 (already included in applied/in-progress)\n  Spring Y1: 16\n  Fall Y2: 16\n  Spring Y2: 17\n  Fall Y3: 15\n  Spring Y3: 15\n  Fall Y4: 16\n  Spring Y4: 15\n  Planned total after these semesters: ~126 credits (including the 31 already applied). This meets the 120-credit graduation requirement and ensures 40 upper-level credits by including enough 300+ courses.\n\nPrerequisite verification summary:\n- CS sequence maintained: CS180 -> CS181/191 -> CS260 -> CS310 -> upper-level CS courses -> CS495/497.\n- Math sequence maintained: MATH198 -> MATH263 -> MATH264 -> MATH285 (if chosen) for linear algebra option.\n- Data Science minor sequence: CS180/181 and STAT190 before DATA222; DATA324 after DATA222.\n- Lab science requirement satisfied by PHYS195 taken Spring Year 2.\n\nPlaceholders removed:\n- All 'CS XXX', 'AH elective', 'Social elective', 'Lab Science' placeholders were replaced with catalog-specific examples (CS 315, CS 325, CS 390, PHYS 195, ARTS 200, HIST 101, etc.). If you prefer different electives within the allowed lists (Area A/B/C), swap with the equivalent course but maintain prerequisites and level.\n\nAction items for you (student):\n1) Confirm which Social Perspective course section meets Missouri Statute (HIST or POL with MO attribute) and enroll in that section.\n2) Decide whether you will take STAT 190 or STAT 290 (both meet Statistics Perspective and minor requirement); I recommended STAT 190 earlier to align with sample plan.\n3) Confirm foreign language requirement: BS degree requires Elementary II proficiency — if not completed, schedule Elementary I/II across early semesters or test out if eligible.\n4) Work with your advisor to confirm offerings/terms for CS electives (some 300+ courses may be offered only certain semesters). Adjust plan if courses are not offered when scheduled.\n5) Monitor GPA requirements: Major (2.0 min) and minor (2.5 min) GPAs required — maintain progress and retake courses if needed.\n6) Complete Missouri Civics Exam before graduation (schedule through Assessment & Testing Office).\n\nIf you want, I can now:\n- Produce a tight per-semester credit-by-credit schedule with exact credit totals per semester adjusted to 15-17 credits (I left two semesters flagged for small adjustments), or\n- Swap any elective suggestions for alternatives from the CS elective lists (Area A/B/C) or Truman general education options.\n\nNote: This plan strictly follows Truman sample plan sequencing, replaces placeholders with valid course codes, and verifies prerequisites logically per the CS curriculum. For final enrollment, consult the CS advisor to ensure course offerings and any co-requisite updates."}
