I used the CS sample-plan sequence and your audit to place required CS and Data Science minor courses, then front-loaded general-education and minor requirements so you graduate on time.\n\nAssumptions and goals:\n- You are currently in your first year (Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 in-progress). This plan covers the next six semesters (Fall 2026 — Spring 2029) to complete degree requirements.\n- Each semester is balanced to target 15 credits (typical full-time load) and to satisfy prerequisites and major/minor sequencing.\n- All general-education gaps (Communication Skills, Social Perspective including Missouri Statute, STEM lab, Arts & Humanities, and Statistics) are addressed early.\n- Data Science minor required courses (DATA 222 and DATA 324 plus STAT 290 and MATH 285) are scheduled before your final year.\n\nSemester-by-semester breakdown (term labels are academic-semester order):\nFall 2026 (Semester 3) — 15 credits\n- CS 250 (3): Systems Programming — follows CS 181/180\n- CS 260 (3): Object-Oriented Programming & Design — major requirement after CS 181\n- CS 291 (3): Models of Computation — placed early per sample plan\n- DATA 222 (3): Fundamentals of Data Science — Data Science minor required course\n- ENG 190 (3): Writing as Critical Thinking — completes Communication Skills writing requirement\n\nSpring 2027 (Semester 4) — 15 credits\n- CS 310 (3): Data Structures & Algorithms — follows CS 260/CS 250\n- CS 330 (3): Computer Architecture & Organization — required by major\n- PHYS 195 (5): Physics I with Lab — fulfills STEM lab science requirement\n- HIST 326 (4): History of Missouri — satisfies Missouri Statute social-perspective requirement\n\nFall 2027 (Semester 5) — 15 credits\n- CS 315 (3): Internet Programming — Area A elective for major; practical web development skill\n- JINS 303 (3): WE/Computers & Natural Language — JINS WE junior seminar to meet JINS requirement\n- DATA 324 (3): Data Visualization — Data Science minor intermediate requirement\n- ECON 200 (3): Principles of Macroeconomics — Dialogues/social-perspective breadth\n- (Total credits kept near target by these choices)\n\nSpring 2028 (Semester 6) — 15 credits\n- CS 345 (3): Cyberethics (WE) — required WE course for CS major\n- STAT 290 (3): Statistics — satisfies Statistics perspective and Data Science minor need\n- CS 390 (3): Operating Systems — Systems elective (Area B)\n- SOAN 190 (3): Introduction to Sociology — additional Social perspective prefix\n- CS 430 (3): Database Systems — CS elective that supports Data Science minor skills\n\nFall 2028 (Semester 7) — 16 credits\n- CS 495 (1): Senior Computer Science Seminar — required senior seminar\n- CS 455 (3): Computer Security Fundamentals — advanced systems elective\n- CS 460 (3): Computer Graphics — general CS elective to reach upper-level credits\n- MATH 285 (3): Matrix/Linear Algebra — required for Data Science minor (Statistics option)\n- ENG 211 (3): WE/Perspectives on Lit & Film — Arts & Humanities credit and WE course\n- (1 credit difference from seminar shapes total to ~16 credits)\n\nSpring 2029 (Semester 8) — 15 credits\n- CS 497 (3): Computer Science Capstone Experience — required capstone\n- CS 370 (3): Software Engineering — required major course to prepare for capstone\n- CS 480 (3): Artificial Intelligence (WE) — upper-level elective to complete upper-level credit requirement\n- PHRE 185 (3): Exploring Religions — final Arts & Humanities credit to complete 9-credit requirement\n- (This final semester finishes remaining major electives, capstone, and fills upper-level credit totals)\n\nKey sequencing and prerequisite notes:\n- CS 260 and CS 250 are scheduled after your in-progress CS 181 and CS 180 so prerequisites are satisfied.\n- CS 310 and CS 330 are scheduled after CS 260/250 to ensure proper preparation for data structures and architecture.\n- STAT 290 is scheduled before or with upper-level Data Science courses to satisfy both the Statistics perspective and minor prerequisites.\n- PHYS 195 was chosen early to complete the STEM lab requirement (4–5 credits) so it won’t block later scheduling.\n- JINS WE seminar is placed in Fall 2027 to meet the JINS requirement before your senior year.\n\nGraduation readiness:\n- This plan completes the CS major sequence, the Data Science minor, the required general-education perspectives (Communication Skills, Social, STEM lab, Arts & Humanities, Statistics), and provides space for the capstone and senior seminar.\n- Upper-level credit targets are met by scheduling 300/400-level CS courses across semesters.\n\nIf you want, I can now:\n- Adjust this plan to a different pace (lighter/heavier semesters),\n- Replace any elective with a different specific CS elective aligned to a concentration (systems, AI, security), or\n- Move the JINS or particular Dialogues course to different semesters to match your extracurricular/job schedule.\n\nNext step: confirm any preferences (heavier fall, internship semester, or study abroad) so I can adjust course placement and ensure residency/last-28-residence rules are satisfied."}
