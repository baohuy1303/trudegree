It front-loads general education requirements (writing, statistics, Missouri statute, arts/humanities, social) and the Data Science minor courses early so you have room for capstone and upper-level CS electives in later semesters. The plan balances each semester to meet the 15–17 credit guideline and ensures completion of major, minor, STEM, and general education requirements by the end of the plan."
