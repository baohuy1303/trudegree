  "text": "Planned semesters start after your current in-progress courses (Fall 2025 / Spring 2026 listed in your audit). I kept all in-progress courses unchanged and planned future semesters to complete Truman Disciplinary Perspectives, CS major requirements, the Data Science minor requirements, and upper-level credit requirements. Each semester is balanced to stay within the typical 12–17 credit load.\n\nSpring 2026 (current/in-progress & keep as-is):\n- CS 181 (Foundations of Computer Science II) — IP\n- CS 191 (Computing Structures) — IP\n- CS 333 (Computer Systems Architecture) — IP\n- MATH 263 (Analytic Geom & Calc II) — IP\n- PHRE 186 (Introduction to Philosophy) — IP\n\nFall 2026 (Semester 3):\n- CS 260 (Object-Oriented Programming & Design) — major requirement\n- CHEM 131 (Chemical Principles II with lab) — STEM Lab requirement (4 credits)\n- ENG 190 (Writing as Critical Thinking) — Communication Skills: Writing\n- COMM 170 (Public Speaking) — Communication Skills: Speaking\n(Estimated credits: ~15)\n\nSpring 2027 (Semester 4):\n- CS 310 (Data Structures and Algorithms) — major requirement (prereq: CS 260/CS191 as satisfied)\n- STAT 290 (Statistics) — Statistics Perspective & support requirement\n- MATH 285 (Linear Algebra) — support for Data Science minor/statistics option\n- CS 315 (Internet Programming) — major requirement\n(Estimated credits: ~15)\n\nFall 2027 (Semester 5):\n- CS 345 (Cyberethics) — major requirement\n- DATA 222 (Fundamentals of Data Science) — Data Science minor core\n- CS 430 (Database Systems) — CS elective / required for Data Science (CS option)\n- HIST 104 (US History I) — satisfies Missouri Statute for Social Perspective\n(Estimated credits: ~15)\n\nSpring 2028 (Semester 6):\n- CS 370 (Software Engineering) — major requirement\n- DATA 324 (Data Visualization) — Data Science minor\n- ECON 200 (Principles of Macroeconomics) — Social Perspective (different prefix from HIST)\n- JINS 300 (Interdisciplinary WE Junior Seminar) — Interconnecting Perspectives requirement\n(Estimated credits: ~15)\n\nFall 2028 (Semester 7):\n- CS 455 (Computer Security) — Systems Elective (choose one from systems list)\n- CS 480 (Artificial Intelligence) — upper-level CS elective\n- BIOL 107 (Cells, Molecules & Genes) — optional additional STEM lab/ breadth if needed for STEM or upper-level credit\n- Upper-level elective (300/400-level) to reach upper-level credit totals (advisor-approved course)\n(Estimated credits: 12–16 depending on elective choice)\n\nSpring 2029 (Semester 8 — Senior year & capstone):\n- CS 495 (Senior Computer Science Seminar) — required senior seminar\n- CS 497 (Computer Science Capstone Experience) — required capstone\n- STAT 520 (Data Mining & Multivariate Statistics) — to complete Data Science minor STAT option requirement (consult advisor for enrollment/availability)\n- Remaining elective (upper-level) to reach ~15 credits and finish upper-level credit requirement\n(Estimated credits: ~12–15)\n\nNotes and next steps (please review with your advisor):\n- I preserved all in-progress courses listed in your DegreeWorks audit. This plan assumes those in-progress courses are successfully completed.\n- The Data Science minor requires the STAT Option for Computer Science majors; that path includes a linear algebra course (MATH 285) and an advanced multivariate/statistics course (STAT 520 or DATA 520). STAT 520 / DATA 520 may be a 500-level course with prerequisites — confirm with the Data Science minor coordinator and your advisor whether an equivalent 300/400-level course can be substituted or whether you should take a different approved elective to meet the minor’s residency and GPA rules.\n- If STAT 520 / DATA 520 are not available or appropriate, work with your advisor to substitute an approved course listed by the minor (the audit and the Data Science minor description will list acceptable alternatives).\n- The plan includes specific courses to eliminate placeholders (ENG 190, COMM 170, CHEM 131, STAT 290, JINS 300, HIST 104, etc.). If any of these are inconsistent with your interests or schedule, your advisor can suggest substitutes from the Truman Perspectives lists that still meet the same requirements.\n- Make sure to verify prerequisites and term offerings each semester (some CS electives or 400-level courses are not offered every term). If a planned course is not offered in the intended term, swap with another required or elective course from the same requirement category and keep prerequisite order intact.\n- Confirm seat availability and any special enrollment restrictions (especially for 400/500-level courses) before registration.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a version of this plan with exact credit totals per semester,\n- swap specific elective choices based on your interests (security, systems, AI, databases), or\n- adjust the minor plan if you prefer to follow the Computer Science option vs. the STAT option for the Data Science minor (and then update required courses accordingly).\n\nMeet with your CS advisor to finalize course term offerings and to confirm the Data Science minor path before registering."
