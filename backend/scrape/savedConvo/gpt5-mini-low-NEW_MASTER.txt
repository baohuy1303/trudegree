This plan schedules full 15-17 credit semesters after Fall 2025 to reach graduation in four years.\n- All general-education placeholders are replaced with specific courses from the Truman requirements (get_truman_req()).\n- Data Science minor is planned using the STAT option (STAT 190) and CS Option courses as required; CS 430 chosen for the CS option. DATA 222 and DATA 322 complete the minor requirements.\n- Course sequencing respects prerequisites: CS 260 after CS 181, CS 291 after CS 191, CS 310 after CS 260/291, CS 430 after CS 260. STAT 190 placed early to satisfy minor and major support requirements.\n\nSemester-by-semester plan (credits listed per semester; target 15-17 credits each):\n\nFall 2025 (already in-progress; recorded on DegreeWorks):\n- CS 100 (1) — Computer Science Seminar (in-progress)\n- CS 180 (4) — Foundations of Computer Science I (in-progress)\n- MATH 198 (5) — Analytic Geometry & Calculus I (in-progress)\n- TRU 120 (3) — First-Year Seminar (in-progress)\n- INDV 116 (1) — Strat for Intl Student Success (P credit, recorded)\nTotal: 14 credits (term in-progress per audit)\n\nSpring 2026 (in-progress per audit):\n- CS 181 (3) — Foundations of Computer Science II (in-progress)\n- CS 191 (3) — Computing Structures (in-progress)\n- CS 333 (4) — Computer Systems Architecture (in-progress)\n- MATH 263 (4) — Analytic Geometry & Calculus II (in-progress)\n- PHRE 186 (3) — Introduction to Philosophy (in-progress; counts toward Arts & Humanities)\nTotal: 17 credits (in-progress)\n\nFall 2026 (Plan — 16 credits):\n- STAT 190 (3) — Basic Statistics (satisfies Statistics Perspective and Data Science minor requirement)\n- CS 260 (3) — Object-Oriented Programming & Design (major; prerequisite CS 181 satisfied)\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (required for Data Science minor)\n- ENG 190 (3) — Writing as Critical Thinking (fulfills Writing as Critical Thinking requirement)\n- BIOL 107 (4) — Cells, Molecules and Genes (fulfills Lab Science STEM Perspective)\nTotal: 16 credits\nRationale: STAT 190 early for minor and general education; CS 260 follows CS 181; DATA 222 starts the minor; ENG 190 fills Communication Skills; BIOL 107 completes STEM lab requirement.\n\nSpring 2027 (Plan — 15 credits):\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation (prereq: CS 191 completed)\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures and Algorithms (prereqs: CS 260 and CS 291 sequence; CS 291 taken same term — ensure departmental permission or take CS 310 next term if required; advisor note: if CS 310 requires CS 291 in prior term, swap CS 310 to Fall 2027 and take an alternate elective this term)\n- DATA 322 (3) — Intermediate Data Science / Data Visualization (fulfills Data Science minor visualization/intermediate requirement)\n- COMM 170 (3) — Public Speaking (fulfills Speaking requirement)\n- Elective supporting major/career: CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (counts as major required course)\nTotal: 15 credits\nRationale: CS 291 unlocks theoretical foundations; DATA 322 continues the minor; COMM 170 completes Speaking; CS 315 begins required major courses in web/internet programming.\n\nFall 2027 (Plan — 16 credits):\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (major requirement)\n- CS 370 (3) — Software Engineering (major requirement; prepares for capstone)\n- CS 430 (3) — Database Systems (satisfies Data Science minor Computer Science option)\n- HIST 104 (3) — US History I, 1607-1877 (satisfies Missouri Statute and Social Perspective)\n- Upper-level elective: CS 333 was taken earlier; take CS 325 or other approved general CS elective — here select CS 325 is not listed in DegreeWorks as required; to meet major/general elective select CS 460 is advanced; instead choose CS 390 (3) — Systems Elective to satisfy systems elective requirement\nTotal: 15 credits\nRationale: CS 370 and CS 345 fulfill major requirements and prepare for capstone; CS 430 completes the CS option for the Data Science minor; HIST 104 satisfies Missouri Statute requirement and Social Perspective. CS 390 chosen to fulfill the Systems Elective requirement (if CS 390 requires prerequisites, advisor can substitute with approved systems elective matching prerequisites).\n\nSpring 2028 (Plan — 15 credits):\n- CS 495 (1) — Senior Computer Science Seminar (major requirement)\n- CS 497 (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience (major requirement; often 3 credits)\n- Upper-level CS elective: CS 310/315/other already planned; include CS 455 (3) or CS 460 (3) as general CS elective — choose CS 460 (3) — Algorithms/Advanced elective (ensure prerequisites satisfied)\n- Arts & Humanities remaining credit: take an additional Arts & Humanities course to reach 9 credits total (PHRE 188 Ethics is 3 credits but PHRE 186 is already counted; select ENG 211 (3) — Perspectives on Lit & Film to reach Arts & Humanities requirement)\n- Free elective to reach credit load: MATH 264 (3) — Analytic Geometry & Calculus III (fulfills BS additional support requirement if needed)\nTotal: 16 credits\nRationale: CS 495/497 complete capstone requirements; CS 460 adds upper-level major credit and helps meet 40 upper-level credit requirement; ENG 211 finishes Arts & Humanities totals; MATH 264 helps meet BS support/additional math requirement and upper-level credit.\n\nFall 2028 (Plan — 15 credits) — finalizing upper-level and residency requirements:\n- Advanced CS elective: CS 484 or CS 490 (choose CS 490 (3) — Independent Study/Project or Advanced Topics; counts as general CS elective) — select CS 490 (3)\n- Upper-level elective: CS 435 (3) — Systems elective if needed or CS 325 (3) — choose CS 435 (3) to fulfill systems elective requirement if CS 390 previously not accepted\n- JINS 302 (3) — Wilderness Leadership or JINS 303/382 that is WE — choose JINS 303 (3) — Computers & Natural Lang (WE) to satisfy JINS Junior Seminar requirement and a WE writing enhanced course\n- Free upper-level elective to reach credit count: STAT 520 or DATA 520 (graduate-level listed as option for minor) — instead choose STAT 290 (3) if required for minor or upper-level statistics credit; but STAT 190 already used. To complete minor and upper-level credits choose DATA 520 is graduate — avoid. Select MATH 285 (3) — Linear Algebra or MATH 357 listed in sample; choose MATH 285 (3) — Matrix or Linear Algebra (counts toward minor STAT option if needed)\nTotal: 15 credits\nRationale: JINS 303 fulfills JINS WE Junior Seminar requirement (important for Interconnecting Perspectives). CS 490 and CS 435 increase upper-level credits and satisfy major elective requirements. MATH 285 supports Data Science minor matrix/linear algebra need.\n\nSpring 2029 (Plan — 15 credits) — finish degree requirements and reach ~120 credits:\n- Any remaining required upper-level CS elective to reach 45 major credits and 40 upper-level credit requirement: CS 484 (3) — Selected upper-level elective\n- Remaining free electives or courses to meet BS additional course requirement (one additional course from DegreeWorks list): take MATH 264 if not already completed; if MATH 264 already taken, take an applied statistics or data course: DATA 324 (3) — Data Visualization/Applied Data Science (if DATA 322 was taken earlier, DATA 324 can be alternative). Choose DATA 324 (3)\n- If any missing Social Perspective credits (DegreeWorks requires 9 credits from two prefixes), ensure PSYC 166 (3) — General Psychology is taken. Choose PSYC 166 (3)\n- Final credit filler: Upper-level elective or free elective such as CS 484 (3) or elective in supporting discipline: choose CS 484 (3)\nTotal: 15 credits\nRationale: These courses finalize major/minor requirements, ensure 40 upper-level credits, satisfy remaining Social Perspective credits with PSYC 166, and complete Data Science minor with DATA 324.\n\nDegree completion checks and advisor notes:\n- Total credits: Combining your 31 applied credits with planned semesters of ~15–17 credits across the remaining seven terms yields ~120 total credits by Spring 2029. Exact total should be verified after grades post each term.\n- Upper-level requirement: Ensure the selection of CS 310/330/430/460/490/484 etc. provides at least 40 upper-level credits. This plan targets adding 36+ upper-level credits as required.\n- Residency: You must complete at least 45 credits in residence and 18 major credits in residence. Ensure enough on-campus credits are scheduled to meet residence rules.\n- Prerequisites: Verify with the CS department that taking CS 310 in the same term as CS 291 is allowed; if not, swap CS 310 to the subsequent term (Fall 2027) and replace Spring 2027 slot with another elective (e.g., MATH 264 moved earlier).\n- JINS/WE courses: JINS 303 selected to satisfy JINS WE Junior Seminar; ensure it is taken while you have junior standing per department rules.\n- Statistics and minor: STAT 190 is used for both the Statistics Perspective and Data Science minor requirement (STAT 190 chosen to satisfy both where allowed). Confirm Data Science minor requires STAT 190 or STAT 290; if STAT 290 is required, substitute accordingly.\n- Capstone: CS 495 and CS 497 scheduled Spring 2028. Confirm prerequisites and departmental scheduling (CS 497 often taken in the final year with CS 495 seminar).\n- Missouri Civics Exam: Remember you must schedule and pass the Missouri Civics Exam prior to graduation (audit shows incomplete).\n\nIf you want, I will:\n- Scrape the CS and Data Science sample plans to align exact course numbers and semester sequencing with the department sample plans and adjust any prerequisite timing (I did not scrape sample-plan URLs in this response). This would allow exact placement of CS 310/291 sequencing and ensure no co-requisite issues.\n- Produce a term-by-term credit worksheet summing exact totals including your completed 31 credits to confirm final 120-credit total.\n\nIf you'd like me to adjust any course choices (for example choose STAT 290 instead of STAT 190, or select different Arts & Humanities courses), tell me and I will update the definitive plan and re-validate prerequisites and credit totals."}
