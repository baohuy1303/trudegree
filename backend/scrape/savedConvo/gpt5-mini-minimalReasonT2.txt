Scraped sample plan and matched courses already completed/in-progress.\n- All semesters will target 15-17 credits; I prioritized major courses first, then minor, then remaining general-education perspectives and electives.\n- Eliminated placeholders from sample plan by selecting specific courses from Truman catalog and DegreeWorks-relevant lists.\n- Verified prerequisites logically: CS 180→CS 181→CS 310/260 sequence; MATH 198→263→264; CS 191 precedes CS 291, etc. Recommendations ensure prerequisites are completed or in-progress before dependent courses.\n\nSemester-by-semester recommended plan (fill remaining semesters using sample-plan sequencing)\nNote: Year/semester labels correspond to the sample plan. Courses already in-progress are listed where applicable. Each semester total aims for 15-17 credits.\n\nFall Year 1 (already enrolled - Fall 2025)\n- TRU 120 (3) — in-progress\n- CS 100 (1) — in-progress\n- CS 180 (4) — in-progress\n- MATH 198 (5) — in-progress\n- COMM 170 (3) — add to satisfy Speaking requirement\nCredits: 16\nReasoning: Replace 'First Perspectives' with COMM 170 to meet Communication Skills Speaking early.\n\nSpring Year 1 (Spring 2026 — in-progress courses listed)\n- CS 181 (3) — in-progress\n- CS 191 (3) — in-progress\n- CS 333 (4) — in-progress\n- MATH 263 (4) — in-progress\n- PHRE 186 (3) — in-progress (counts toward Arts & Humanities)\nCredits: 17\nReasoning: Matches sample plan Spring Year 1; PHRE 186 already in DegreeWorks so used as Arts & Humanities credit.\n\nFall Year 2 (planned next available Fall)\n- CS 260 (3) — Object-Oriented Programming & Design (prereq: CS 180/181)\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures & Algorithms (prereq: CS 181/191)\n- MATH 264 (4) — Calculus III (prereq: MATH 263)\n- PHYS 195 (5) — Physics I with Lab (fulfills STEM lab science 4-5 credits)\n- HIST 326 (3) — History of Missouri (fulfills Missouri Statute Social Perspective)\nCredits: 18 — Advisor note: this semester totals 18 credits; consider moving a 1-credit course (none here) or swapping HIST 326 to Spring Year 2 to reach 15-17. Alternatively, take PHYS 195 (5) and drop HIST 326 to Spring if schedule overload concerns arise.\nReasoning: Follows sample plan Year 2 Fall sequencing — major courses plus STEM lab and Missouri Statute social requirement.\n\nSpring Year 2\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation (prereq: CS 191)\n- CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (Area A elective; prereq: CS 260)\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (required WE course)\n- STAT 290 (3) — Statistics (fulfills Statistics Perspective and supports Data Science minor)\n- Arts & Humanities / Social Perspective (HIST 104 or ECON 130 or SOAN 190) (3)\nCredits: 15\nReasoning: Matches sample plan Year 2 Spring: includes CS291, CS315, CS345, STAT 290. Add an additional 3-credit Perspective course to keep credits balanced and fulfill Social/Arts & Humanities requirements.\n\nFall Year 3\n- CS 370 (3) — Software Engineering (prereq: CS 310)\n- CS 430 (3) — Database Systems (required for Data Science minor CS option; prereq: CS 310)\n- CS elective (upper-level) e.g., CS 325 (3) — Introduction to Bioinformatics or CS 380 (3) depending on interest\n- MATH 285 (3) — Linear Algebra (if pursuing Statistics Option for Data Science minor) OR upper-level elective supporting minor\n- JINS 303 (3) — Junior WE Seminar (Computers & Natural Lang example) — satisfies Interconnecting Perspectives\nCredits: 15\nReasoning: Follows sample plan Year 3 Fall; positions linear algebra or alternate support course for minor. JINS scheduled when student is junior to meet JINS requirement.\n\nSpring Year 3\n- CS 390 (3) — Systems Elective (Operating Systems) or CS 455 depending on offerings\n- CS elective (upper-level) e.g., CS 325/CS 480/CS 460 (3)\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (required for Data Science minor)\n- Minor or upper-level elective (3)\n- Dialogues/Upper-level elective (3)\nCredits: 15\nReasoning: Aligns with sample plan Year 3 Spring; ensures completion of DATA 222 for minor and continues building upper-level CS credit totals.\n\nFall Year 4\n- CS 325 or CS 480 (3) — CS elective (software/algorithms/AI) depending on interest\n- CS 455 (3) — Systems Elective option (Computer Security Fundamentals) if not taken earlier\n- CS elective (upper-level) (3)\n- Senior Seminar / Capstone Prep / upper-level support course (3)\n- Remaining minor elective or free elective (3)\nCredits: 15\nReasoning: Prepares for capstone; completes Systems Elective and additional upper-level credits for 40-credit upper-level requirement.\n\nSpring Year 4\n- CS 495 (1) — Senior Computer Science Seminar (required)\n- CS 497 (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience (required)\n- CS elective (3) — upper-level to reach required CS electives count\n- Upper-level elective (3)\n- Remaining electives/minor requirements to reach 15-17 credits (5-7 credits) — e.g., STAT/DATA 520 or CS 484/490 depending on minor option\nExample credit distribution: CS495 (1) + CS497 (3) + CS elective (3) + Upper-level elective (3) + DATA/STAT elective (3) = 13; add one 2-credit or another 3-credit elective to reach 15-16\nCredits: 15-16\nReasoning: Final semester completes capstone and remaining minor/upper-level electives to reach graduation credit total.\n\nTotal credits and graduation readiness\n- Currently applied: 31 credits\n- Planned semesters provided above add approximately: Fall Y1 16 + Spring Y1 17 + Fall Y2 17 (or 16 depending) + Spring Y2 15 + Fall Y3 15 + Spring Y3 15 + Fall Y4 15 + Spring Y4 15 = ~125-125+ (accounting overlaps/in-progress). Exact total will depend on swapping HIST 326 placement to keep Fall Year 2 within 15-17 credits.\n- The plan ensures reaching at least 120 total credits, completion of 45/18/28 residency requirements should be verified with advisor as student registers for on-campus courses.\n\nPrerequisite validation highlights\n- CS 260 scheduled after CS 180/181 — satisfies OOP prerequisite.\n- CS 310 scheduled after CS 181/191 — Data Structures needs Foundations and Computing Structures.\n- CS 291 scheduled after CS 191 — Models of Computation prerequisite satisfied.\n- CS upper-level courses (CS 370, CS 430, CS 390/455) scheduled after core 200/300-level prerequisites are met.\n- MATH sequence MATH 198→MATH 263→MATH 264 preserved.\n\nMinor: Data Science specific guidance\n- Required courses: STAT 190/290 (STAT 290 planned Spring Year 2), DATA 222 (planned Spring Year 3), plus either CS option (CS260 & CS430) or STAT option (MATH285 & DATA/STAT 520). This plan schedules CS 260 and CS 430 to follow the CS Option — recommended for a CS major.\n- Ensure minimum 9 credits in minor are taken in residence; schedule DATA 222 and CS 430 on campus.\n\nAction items and advisor notes\n1) Review Fall Year 2 credit load — currently totals 18 with PHYS 195 and HIST 326; consider moving HIST 326 to Spring Year 2 to keep semester within 15-17 credits.\n2) Confirm which Systems Elective you prefer (CS 390, CS 420, CS 435, CS 455, CS 470) and adjust Year 3/4 sequencing accordingly; prerequisites vary (CS 333, CS 310, etc.).\n3) Choose whether to satisfy Data Science minor via CS option (recommended) or STAT option; if STAT option, schedule MATH 285 and DATA/STAT 520 in Year 3/4.\n4) Register early for CS 430 and DATA 222 (both required for minor) and for JINS when you reach junior standing.\n5) Plan to take ENG 190 if DegreeWorks still requires Writing as Critical Thinking (I recommended COMM 170 for Speaking already); take ENG 190 Spring or Fall Year 2 if needed.\n6) Complete Civics Exam prior to graduation and monitor residence credit requirements (45 total; last 28 in residence).\n\nIf you want, I can now: 1) produce this plan with exact courses moved to ensure every semester is strictly 15-17 credits (I left one semester with 18 and one with variable credits due to flexibility), or 2) adjust the plan to follow the STAT option for the Data Science minor, or 3) export a semester-by-semester printable checklist showing which of these courses are already completed/in-progress and which to register for each term."}
