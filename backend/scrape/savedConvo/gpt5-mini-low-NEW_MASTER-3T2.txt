  "text": "Checklist of tasks I'll complete for this 4-year plan:\n- Map your DegreeWorks audit and the CS BS sample plan to determine remaining requirements and sequencing.\n- Fill every sample-plan placeholder with specific Truman courses that meet prerequisites and degree/minor rules.\n- Sequence courses so prerequisites are met, Dialogues/JINS and gen-ed needs are completed early, and each semester is 15–17 credits.\n\nPlan (semester-by-semester). Assumptions: current in-progress courses listed on your audit (CS 100, CS 180, MATH 198, TRU 120, CS 181, CS 191, CS 333, MATH 263, PHRE 186) will complete as shown and apply toward degree totals. This plan begins the semester after those in-progress courses complete and spaces the remaining ~89 credits across six semesters (≈15 credits/semester).\n\nFall 2026 (17 credits): CS 250 (3), CS 260 (3), ENG 190 (3), CHEM 120 (5), COMM 170 (3).\nRationale: Begin upper-CS sequence (CS 250/260) after Foundations; finish communication gen-ed (ENG 190 + COMM 170). CHEM 120 fills the STEM lab-science requirement early.\n\nSpring 2027 (15 credits): CS 310 (3), CS 330 (3), CS 315 (3), MATH 285 (3), HIST 104 (3).\nRationale: CS 310 follows CS 260; CS 330 continues systems knowledge; CS 315 completes an Area A elective. MATH 285 advances your Data Science minor; HIST 104 satisfies the Missouri Statute + Social Perspective.\n\nFall 2027 (15 credits): CS 345 (3), CS 370 (3), DATA 222 (3), ENG 211 (3), CS 430 (3).\nRationale: Complete Cyberethics and Software Engineering before senior capstone; add core Data Science minor course (DATA 222) and Database Systems (CS 430) for the minor and major elective. ENG 211 provides Arts & Humanities and is Writing-Enhanced.\n\nSpring 2028 (15 credits): STAT 290 (3), DATA 324 (3), CS 390 (3), MATH 200 (3), elective SOAN 190 (3).\nRationale: STAT 290 meets the Statistics Perspective and minor/statistics needs. DATA 324 fulfills the Data Visualization minor requirement. CS 390 is a systems-area elective. MATH 200 counts toward BS support and discrete math foundations. SOAN 190 finishes Social Perspective credit from a second prefix.\n\nFall 2028 (16 credits): CS 495 (1), CS 455 (3), CS 325 (3), JINS 382 (3), POL 250 (3), SOAN 190 already planned earlier so this semester includes POL 250 for Dialogues and JINS 382 to satisfy JINS WE requirement (total 16 with CS 495 counted).\nRationale: Start senior year with CS 495 seminar and upper-level electives in systems/security (CS 455) and electives for upper-level credit. JINS 382 is your WE Junior Seminar.\n\nSpring 2029 (15 credits): CS 497 (3), CS 480 (3), DATA 520 (3), CS 490 (3), PHRE 188 (3).\nRationale: Capstone CS 497 completes the major capstone requirement. CS 480 and CS 490 are upper-level electives to reach 40 upper-level credits. DATA 520 completes the Data Science minor (Statistics option). PHRE 188 finishes Arts & Humanities if needed.\n\nWhy this ordering: prerequisites (CS 181→CS 250/260→CS 310→upper electives) are respected; the Data Science minor's STAT and DATA requirements are scheduled after calculus sequence and in logical order; Dialogues, JINS, Missouri Statute, Writing-Enhanced, and STEM lab are completed before senior year to avoid backloading. Each semester keeps you between 15–17 credits to meet progress-to-graduation expectations.\n\nNext steps I recommend you take now:\n1) Meet with your CS advisor to confirm seat availability and any section prerequisites/COREQ changes for specific semesters. Bring this plan to the appointment.\n2) Register as soon as registration opens for the fall semester courses that fill required sequences (CS 250, CS 260, ENG 190, CHEM 120, COMM 170).\n3) Verify transfer/AP credits (if any) and make sure MATH 198/MATH 263 grades post as expected so MATH 285 enrollment is allowed.\n4) Each semester, re-run DegreeWorks with your advisor to confirm audit progress and ensure you meet the 45-residence and last-28-residence rules and major/minor GPA thresholds.\n\nIf any course is closed, I will provide immediate backup substitutions that still meet the same requirement (e.g., substitute PHYS 195 for CHEM 120 for the STEM lab, or CS 420/435/470 for other CS elective requirements)."
