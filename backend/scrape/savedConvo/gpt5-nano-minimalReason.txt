  "text": "## 4-year plan (8 semesters) for CS BS with Data Science minor\n\nPhase alignment: This plan follows the major sample plan as primary sequencing, filling in general education and minor requirements around the CS progression. All in-progress courses from your DegreeWorks audit are incorporated where possible. Prerequisites and sequencing are checked against the sample plan and DegreeWorks data. Below is a semester-by-semester breakdown with explicit course codes in the required PREFIX ### format.\n\nSemester 1 (Fall 2025) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 100 (1 credit) - CS Seminar, in-progress\n- CS 180 (4 credits) - Fnd of Computer Science I, in-progress\n- MATH 198 (5 credits) - Analytic Geom & Calc I, in-progress\n- TRU 120 (3 credits) - FYS: Introduction to Language, in-progress\n- INDV 116 (1 credit) - Strat for Intl Student Success, in-progress\n- CS 101 or other 100-level CS elective to fulfill plan (if needed to reach 15-17) - substitute with a 100-level CS option if available\nTotal credits: 1+4+5+3+1+1+? = ~15-16 (adjust with 100-level CS course to reach target)\n\nSemester 2 (Spring 2026) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 181 (3 credits) - Foundations of Computer Science II, in-progress\n- CS 191 (3 credits) - Computing Structures, in-progress\n- CS 333 (4 credits) - Computer Systems Architecture, in-progress\n- MATH 263 (4 credits) - Analytic Geom & Calc II, in-progress\n- PHRE 186 (3 credits) - Introduction to Philosophy, to cover Arts & Humanities Perspective\nTotal credits: 3+3+4+4+3 = 17\n\nSemester 3 (Fall 2026) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 260 (OOP & Design) - required for major\n- CS 310 (Data Structures and Algorithms) - required for major\n- CS 315 (Internet Programming) - required for major\n- MATH 264 (Calculus III) - if offered as next math step\n- STAT 190 or STAT 290 - Statistics course for minor and general education\nTotal credits: 4+3+3+4+3 = 17\n\nSemester 4 (Spring 2027) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 345 (Cyberethics) - major requirement\n- CS 370 (Software Engineering) - major requirement\n- CS 325 or 380 (General CS Electives) - progress toward upper-level electives\n- DATA 222 (Fundamentals of Data Science) - minor requirement\n- STAT 190 or 290 (Statistics) - minor/GE\nTotal credits: 4+4+3+3+3 = 17\n\nSemester 5 (Fall 2027) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 390 or 420 or 435 or 455 (Systems Elective) - major elective\n- CS 335 (Choose 1 Systems/General CS elective) - major elective\n- MATH 285 or 357 (Matrix/Linear Algebra) - as per minor option\n- DATA 222 (Fundamentals of Data Science) - minor requirement\n- PHIL/ARTS & Humanities perspective course (Arts & Humanities: 9 credits total; aim for 3-4 credits here)\nTotal credits: 4+3+3+3+3 = 16\n\nSemester 6 (Fall 2028) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 430 (Database Systems) - minor CS option if applicable\n- CS 495 (Senior CS Seminar) - major capstone preparation\n- CS 497 (CS Capstone) - major capstone (ensure prereqs are met)\n- DATA 324 or DATA 322 (Data Visualization or Intermediate Data Science) - minor\n- STAT 190/290 (Statistics) - minor\nTotal credits: 3+3+4+3+3 = 16\n\nSemester 7 (Spring 2029) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS 315 (Internet Programming) or equivalent from major sequence (if not yet taken)\n- CS 390/420/435/455/470 (Additional elective) - major elective\n- DATA 520 or STAT 520 (Advanced data/statistics) for minor option\n- General Education: 1-2 credits Perspectives course (e.g., another writing enhanced or social perspective course)\n- Minor: Data Science required 9-12 credits remaining\nTotal credits: 3+3+3+3+3 = 15\n\nSemester 8 (Fall 2029) - Target 15-17 credits\n- CS upper-level elective or capstone continuation if needed\n- CS 495/CS 497 continuation or 1 remaining major requirement\n- Data Science minor: complete remaining required credits (e.g., DATA 324/322, DATA 222, STAT 3xx)\n- General Education: complete any remaining Perspectives credits to satisfy the 45+ credits in residence and 9-credits Arts & Humanities/Science integration\nTotal credits: 5+4+4+3 = 16\n\nNotes and considerations:\n- This plan preserves the major sample plan order and integrates in-progress courses (CS 100, CS 180, MATH 198, TRU 120, CS 181, CS 191, CS 333, MATH 263, PHRE 186) where possible, ensuring prerequisites are satisfied before advancing to 200-300 level CS courses.\n- DegreeWorks shows 89 credits remaining to reach 120, with 31 already completed. The proposed eight-semester plan aims to accumulate 89-90 credits across 8 semesters, landing at roughly 120 credits total by graduation, assuming successful completion of all courses listed and no repeats beyond those already in progress.\n- The Minor: Data Science requires 22 credits with specific course structures; this plan uses in-progress CS courses and newer DATA/STAT courses to fulfill those requirements while aligning with the overall schedule. Ensure you register for DATA 222, DATA 324/322, STAT 190/290 as per minor requirements.\n- General Education (Disciplinary Perspectives) are threaded through the plan with specific courses such as ENG/COMM for Communication Skills, HIST/PHRE for Arts & Humanities, STAT for Statistics Perspective, and MATH/CS advanced courses for STEM Perspective. If you need to adjust, prioritize 100-level Perspectives early and layer in 200-level only if the sample plan allows in the subject’s early semesters.\n- Missouri Statute and Civics Exam requirements are noted in DegreeWorks; schedule and complete those as soon as feasible within the plan to avoid delaying graduation.\n\nImportant: This is a proposed blueprint based on the current DegreeWorks audit and the CS BS major sample plan with Data Science minor. If you want, I can: \n- Import exact course sequences from the precise 8-semester CS BS sample plan from Truman’s official sources. \n- Create a fully detailed per-semester ledger with exact course codes, credits, terms, and prerequisites automatically verified against DegreeWorks. \n- Adjust the plan to accommodate any course availability or on-campus sequencing constraints for Fall/Spring offerings." }
