It aligns prerequisites to ensure smooth sequencing (e.g., CS 180 precedes CS 260, etc.), spaces out upper-level CS coursework across later semesters, and keeps a consistent 15–17 credits per term. Current registrations are respected, placeholders are replaced with specific Truman courses drawn from the official plans and the DegreeWorks audit, and the plan aims to satisfy the 120-credit requirement inklusive the 45-credits in residence and other Truman Gen-Ed and major/minor requirements."}
