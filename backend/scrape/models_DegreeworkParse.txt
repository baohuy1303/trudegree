gpt-5-nano: 3m21s -> Missing data science req
gpt-4.1-nano: 32s -> good
gpt-4.1: 1m -> nested no structure
gpt-4.1-nano NEW PROMPT: 50s -> good sometimes bad sometimes (inconsistent)

New benchmark:
Letter Portrait:
    gpt-4.1-mini: T1: 2m -> Very good no missing info || T2: 1m39s -> Req are now marked IP, just some minor naming changes but still the same thing as T1
    gpt-4.1-nano: T1: 37s -> Missing critical info
    gpt-4.1: T1: 1m17s -> Very good, extra fields like credits etc... filled out

    gpt-5-nano lowReasoningVerbose: 16s
    gpt-5-nano Base: 3m10s -> Missing a lot
    gpt-5-nano lowReason: 1m3s -> Missing a lot

    gpt-5-mini lowReason: 88s -> Good caputures all info || T2: 2m -> More info but still the same

    gpt-4o: 38s -> Very good and fast
