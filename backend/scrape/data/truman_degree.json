We recommend starting to compile your work for the Portfolio sooner than later.\nStudents must complete their Application to Graduate\nthe semester prior to graduating\n. Apply to graduate through TruView.\nGraduating seniors need to complete their seniors test and questionnaire. We recommend reviewing the\nAssessment & Testing page\nto plan accordingly.\nThe Dialogues curriculum\nrequires a certain number of courses/credit hours in the following Perspectives: Social, Arts and Humanities, STEM, Communications, and Statistics. The exact number of courses a student will be required to take during their undergraduate career varies individually according to the credit transferred in.\nDepartment Chair:\nPlease contact the\nCenter for Academic Excellence\nwith any updates to the plan above.
