  "text": "## Your Course Plan\nCurrent and In-Progress Courses (do not repeat these in registration): Fall 2025: CS 100 (In Progress), CS 180 (In Progress), MATH 198 (In Progress), TRU 120 (In Progress). Spring 2026: CS 181 (In Progress), CS 191 (In Progress), CS 333 (In Progress), MATH 263 (In Progress), PHRE 186 (In Progress).\n- Fall 2026: CS 260, CS 291, STAT 190, PHYS 195, COMM 170\n- Spring 2027: CS 310, CS 315, CS 345, DATA 222, ENG 190\n- Fall 2027: CS 370, CS 390, DATA 322, MATH 285, PSYC 166\n- Spring 2028: CS 430, CS 460, JINS 303, ENG 211, POL 161\n- Fall 2028: CS 495, DATA 520, HIST 314, MUSI 207, MATH 264\n- Spring 2029: CS 497, ECON 200, DATA 324, ART 203\nRationale: This plan sequences CS major courses from foundations through systems and software engineering, schedules capstone (CS 495/497) in the final year, and completes the Data Science minor via STAT 190, DATA 222, DATA 322, MATH 285, and DATA 520. Dialogues requirements are satisfied: Communication (ENG 190, COMM 170), Social (POL 161, PSYC 166, ECON 200; Missouri Statute via POL 161), STEM (MATH 198, CS 180, PHYS 195), Arts & Humanities (PHRE 186, ENG 211, MUSI 207), Statistics Perspective (STAT 190), JINS (JINS 303), plus two additional Writing-Enhanced courses (ENG 211, HIST 314). Prerequisites and sequencing have been validated (e.g., CS 260/291 before CS 310, CS 310/333 before CS 390, CS 260/310 before CS 370); loads average 15–17 credits to reach 120 by graduation."
