Semester 1 & 2 and then continued the program sequence from the Computer Science sample plan while completing the Data Science minor (STAT option required for CS majors).\n- I chose specific courses to replace all placeholders (Dialogues, Gen Ed, lab science, etc.) using Truman-listed course offerings; prerequisites are respected based on the curriculum sequence (e.g., CS181 → CS260 → CS310).\n- Each semester is targeted to 15–17 credits to keep your load balanced and meet degree credit totals.\n\nSemester 1 — Fall 2025 (16 credits)\n- TRU 120 (3), CS 100 (1), CS 180 (4), MATH 198 (5), ENG 190 (3)\nReason: Close out your first semester requirements; ENG 190 fulfills Writing as Critical Thinking in Communication Skills.\n\nSemester 2 — Spring 2026 (17 credits) [in progress]\n- CS 181 (3), CS 191 (3), CS 333 (4), MATH 263 (4), PHRE 186 (3)\nReason: Core CS and calculus sequence continue; PHRE 186 counts toward Arts & Humanities.\n\nSemester 3 — Fall 2026 (15 credits)\n- CS 250 (3), CS 260 (3), DATA 222 (3), COMM 170 (3), HIST 111 (3)\nReason: Begin intermediate CS (systems + OOP) and the Data Science minor; COMM 170 satisfies Speaking requirement; HIST 111 provides Dialogues/general education credit.\n\nSemester 4 — Spring 2027 (17 credits)\n- CS 310 (3), CS 291 (3), MATH 285 (3), PHYS 195 (5), ENG 211 (3)\nReason: Data structures and theory after CS260/CS191, matrix algebra for the minor, PHYS 195 satisfies STEM lab-science requirement, ENG 211 gives an additional Writing-Enhanced / Arts & Humanities credit.\n\nSemester 5 — Fall 2027 (15 credits)\n- CS 315 (3), CS 370 (3), JINS 303 (3), HIST 104 (3), PSYC 166 (3)\nReason: Major Area A elective (Internet Programming) and Software Engineering (WE). JINS 303 satisfies the JINS Interdisciplinary WE Junior Seminar. HIST 104 satisfies the Missouri Statute requirement; PSYC 166 adds Social Perspective credits.\n\nSemester 6 — Spring 2028 (15 credits)\n- CS 345 (3), STAT 290 (3), CS 420 (3), DATA 324 (3), CS 430 (3)\nReason: Cyberethics (WE) and STAT 290 satisfy Statistics Perspective and the minor. CS420 chosen as the Systems elective; DATA324 completes the Data Visualization requirement for the minor; CS430 is an applied CS elective useful for data work.\n\nSemester 7 — Fall 2028 (16 credits)\n- CS 495 (1), CS 480 (3), CS 460 (3), DATA 520 (3), STAT 370 (3), CS 490 (3)\nReason: Senior seminar (CS495) and a mix of upper-level CS electives (AI, graphics, automata) while completing DATA 520 (Data Mining) for the Data Science minor; STAT 370 strengthens statistical foundations prior to final analytics coursework.\n\nSemester 8 — Spring 2029 (15 credits)\n- CS 497 (3), STAT 478 (3), CS 455 (3), SOAN 190 (3), ART 203 (3)\nReason: Capstone (CS497) completes your CS capstone requirement. STAT 478 and CS 455 are upper-level electives supporting Data Science and security skills. SOAN 190 finishes Social Perspective totals (9 credits across prefixes). ART 203 completes Arts & Humanities credit totals.\n\nHow this plan meets key degree requirements:\n- 120-credit degree target: Semesters are 15–17 credits; combined with your applied 31 credits, this sequence brings you to the required 120+ credits.\n- CS major: All core major courses and sequencing are included (CS260 → CS310 → required electives, Systems elective CS420, CS495, CS497). General CS elective requirement (≥6 credits) is met with CS480 and CS460 (and additional 300+ electives).\n- Data Science minor: DATA 222, DATA 324, MATH 285, STAT 290, DATA 520 complete the STAT-option pathway required for CS majors.\n- General education: Communication Skills (ENG 190 + COMM 170), Social Perspective (HIST 104 + PSYC 166 + SOAN 190 = 9 credits across prefixes), STEM lab (PHYS 195), Arts & Humanities (PHRE 186 + ENG 211 + ART 203 = 9 credits), Statistics Perspective (STAT 290), JINS satisfied by JINS 303, and two additional WE courses covered by CS 370 and CS 345.\n- Writing-Enhanced (WE): JINS 303 (JINS), CS 370, CS 345 provide the required WE experiences.\n\nPrerequisite sequencing highlights:\n- CS260/CS250 are scheduled after CS181/CS180; CS310 follows CS260; CS291 follows CS191. MATH285 scheduled after MATH263. STAT 290 scheduled prior to upper-level STAT courses.\n\nIf you want, I can now:\n- Export this plan as a printable 8-semester checklist,\n- Swap any elective (CS 460 / CS 480 / CS 490 / CS 455) with another specific CS elective based on interest (AI, security, graphics, databases), or\n- Re-sequence any course to accommodate internship/Co-op semesters.\n\nIf you’d like changes (different electives, study abroad term, or to move a course earlier/later), tell me which priorities to adjust and I’ll update the plan."}
