  "text": "Four-year (8-semester) plan — definitive semester-by-semester schedule and rationale. All semesters balanced at 15–17 credits; courses chosen to follow Truman CS sample-plan sequence, satisfy Data Science minor, fulfill general-education perspectives, and complete BS support requirements.\\n\\nFall 2025 (16 credits) — in progress & planned additions:\\n- TRU 120 (3) — First Year Seminar (in-progress)\\n- CS 100 (1) — CS Seminar (in-progress)\\n- CS 180 (4) — Foundations CS I (in-progress)\\n- MATH 198 (5) — Calc I (in-progress)\\n- ENG 190 (3) — Writing as Critical Thinking (added to meet Communication Skills writing and bring semester to 16 credits)\\nRationale: Finish foundational required courses and complete Writing requirement early.\\n\\nSpring 2026 (17 credits) — already scheduled/in-progress:\\n- CS 181 (3) — Foundations CS II (in-progress)\\n- CS 191 (3) — Computing Structures (in-progress)\\n- CS 333 (4) — Computer Systems Architecture (in-progress; counts as upper-level)\\n- MATH 263 (4) — Calc II (in-progress)\\n- PHRE 186 (3) — Intro to Philosophy (in-progress; counts toward Arts & Humanities)\\nRationale: Continue core CS sequence, continue calculus progression, and gain A&H credit.\\n\\nFall 2026 (16 credits):\\n- CS 250 (3) — Systems Programming\\n- CS 260 (3) — Object-Oriented Programming & Design\\n- STAT 190 (3) — Basic Statistics (Statistics Perspective + Data Science minor)\\n- BIOL 107 (4) — Cells, Molecules & Genes w/lab (STEM lab science requirement)\\n- COMM 170 (3) — Public Speaking (Communication Skills speaking)\\nRationale: Begin upper CS coursework and complete lab science and speaking early; STAT190 begins Data Science minor sequence.\\n\\nSpring 2027 (15 credits):\\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures & Algorithms\\n- CS 330 (3) — Computer Architecture & Organization\\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation\\n- MATH 285 (3) — Matrix/Linear Algebra (required for Data Science minor STAT option)\\n- HIST 104 (3) — US History I (satisfies Missouri Statute requirement and Social Perspective)\\nRationale: Continue required CS core, add linear algebra for minor, and satisfy Missouri Statute/Social Perspective.\\n\\nFall 2027 (16 credits):\\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (WE requirement)\\n- CS 370 (3) — Software Engineering\\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (Data Science minor core)\\n- JINS 302 (3) — Junior WE seminar (Interconnecting Perspectives)\\n- MATH 264 (4) — Calc III (chosen as BS Required Support / additional math)\\nRationale: Front-load WE/JINS and Data Science minor courses; progress on BS support (MATH 264 chosen to satisfy additional support).\\n\\nSpring 2028 (15 credits):\\n- CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (Area A elective)\\n- CS 430 (3) — Database Systems (fulfills Data Science minor DB requirement / CS elective)\\n- STAT 290 (3) — Statistics (additional statistics strengthening)\\n- ENG 206 (3) — Dialogues/GE elective\\n- HIST 101 (3) — Dialogues-style humanities/social elective\\nRationale: Continue CS electives relevant to Data Science, complete Dialogues requirements and strengthen statistics background.\\n\\nFall 2028 (16 credits):\\n- CS 455 (3) — Computer Security Fundamentals (Systems elective)\\n- CS 480 (3) — Artificial Intelligence (WE / Area C elective)\\n- ECON 200 (3) — Principles of Macroeconomics (Social Perspective / Dialogues)\\n- JINS 383 (3) — WE/The Computerized Society (Interconnecting Perspectives / WE)\\n- (remaining elective/Dialogues credit fulfilled by above choices)\\nRationale: Finish CS systems electives and Dialogues; add social-perspective depth.\\n\\nSpring 2029 (15 credits) — final semester and graduation-ready:\\n- CS 497 (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience\\n- CS 460 (3) — Computer Graphics (general CS elective / upper-level credit)\\n- CS 484 (3) — AI/advanced CS elective (upper-level)\\n- JINS 319 (3) — WE/Human & Computer Cognition (Interconnecting Perspectives/Dialogues)\\n- PHRE 188 (3) — Ethics (completes Arts & Humanities second-prefix requirement)\\nRationale: Capstone + remaining required upper-level CS electives and final Dialogues/A&H completion.\\n\\nTotal plan notes and validation:\\n- DegreeWorks shows 31 applied credits; planned semesters add ~89 credits to reach 120 total. Each semester targets 15–17 credits.\\n- CS sample-plan sequence followed: core progression CS100→CS180→CS181→CS191→CS250/260→CS310/CS330/CS291→upper-level electives and capstone.\\n- Data Science minor: DATA 222 and DATA 430 included; STAT 190 and MATH 285 included to satisfy statistics-based minor pathway. (Advising note: confirm the minor's STAT/DATA 520 requirement equivalencies with the Data Science advisor if DegreeWorks expects a 500-level course; if so, substitute the required approved undergraduate equivalent per advisor guidance.)\\n- STEM lab science satisfied by BIOL 107. Statistics Perspective satisfied by STAT 190/290. Communication Skills: ENG 190 (writing) and COMM 170 (speaking) included. Arts & Humanities satisfied by PHRE 186 and PHRE 188 (two prefixes). Social Perspective satisfied via HIST 104 and ECON 200 (two prefixes). JINS WE requirement satisfied (JINS 302 and JINS 319/383 selections provide WE credits).\\n- Upper-level credit requirement and 45-major-credit residence requirements are addressed by scheduling required 300/400-level CS courses and capstone across later semesters.\\n- Prerequisite sequencing preserved: Math 198→263→264; CS 180→181→260→310 etc. CS333 (in-progress) counts toward upper-level.\\n- No semester contains generic placeholders; every slot is filled with a specific course code.\\n\\nIf you want, I will: (1) recalculate exact credit totals per Truman catalog credit values and adjust any semester to exactly match 15–17 credits per your preferred load; (2) verify the Data Science minor's graduate-level course expectation (STAT/DATA 520) and adjust the minor plan to the correct STAT-option courses approved for a CS major; or (3) generate an editable checklist you can use each semester when registering."
