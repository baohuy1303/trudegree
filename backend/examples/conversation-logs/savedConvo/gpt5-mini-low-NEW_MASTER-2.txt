  "text": "Semester-by-semester 4-year plan (uses your in-progress courses and maps remaining requirements; each semester targets 15-17 credits)\n\nSpring 2026 (current in-progress) — 17 credits\n- CS 100 (1) — in-progress seminar required for major\n- CS 180 (4) — in-progress foundational CS (counts for major and minor)\n- MATH 198 (5) — in-progress Calculus I (BS support)\n- TRU 120 (3) — First Year Seminar (in-progress)\n- CS 181 (3) — in-progress Foundations II (scheduled Spring)\nNotes: These in-progress courses are included in your plan and satisfy early major/support requirements.\n\nFall 2026 — 17 credits\n- CS 260 (3) — Object-Oriented Programming & Design (prereq: CS 181)\n- MATH 264 (4) — Calculus III (continues math sequence after MATH 263)\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (minor requirement)\n- ENG 190 (3) — Writing as Critical Thinking (Communication Skills requirement)\n- BIOL 107 (4) — Lab science (fulfills STEM Lab Science requirement)\nRationale: Finish core math/support, begin key minor course DATA 222, satisfy Writing and Lab Sci requirements.\n\nSpring 2027 — 15 credits\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures and Algorithms (prereqs: CS 191/CS 260 as scheduled)\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation\n- CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (major requirement)\n- STAT 290 (3) — Statistics (satisfies Statistics Perspective and minor/stat requirement)\n- COMM 170 (3) — Public Speaking (satisfies Speaking requirement)\nRationale: Complete core CS sequence items and the Statistics Perspective; COMM 170 completes speaking requirement.\n\nFall 2027 — 15 credits\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (major requirement)\n- CS 370 (3) — Software Engineering (major requirement)\n- DATA 324 (3) — Data Visualization (minor requirement)\n- PSYC 166 (3) — General Psychology (Social Perspective credit, different prefix)\n- ENG 211 (3) — Perspectives on Literature & Film (additional Arts & Humanities credit to pair with PHRE 186)\nRationale: Finish remaining Data Science minor course DATA 324 and continue upper-level major progression; PSYC 166 and ENG 211 help complete Social and A&H perspectives.\n\nSpring 2028 — 15 credits\n- CS 430 (3) — Database Systems (required for Data Science minor - CS option)\n- CS 420 (3) — Systems elective (chosen to satisfy Systems Elective requirement)\n- CS 325 (3) — CS elective (builds on algorithms/data structures)\n- ECON 201 (3) — Social Science elective to ensure 9 Social credits from multiple prefixes\n- Elective to reach credit target: (no placeholder) — (credits included via courses above total 15)\nRationale: Complete the remaining Data Science minor required CS course (CS 430) and satisfy systems elective and general CS elective needs while ensuring Social Perspective credit distribution.\n\nFall 2028 — 15 credits (senior year)\n- CS 495 (3) — Senior Computer Science Seminar (required)\n- CS 497 (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience (required; may be taken across terms per department policy if needed)\n- CS elective (upper-level) CS 460 (3) — Additional major elective to reach required CS elective credits\n- Upper-level elective (3) — e.g., advanced topic supporting major/career path (counts toward 40 upper-level credits)\n- Free elective to reach 15 credits (3)\nRationale: Finish capstone and seminar, complete remaining major elective/upper-level credit requirements so you meet major and 40 upper-level credit thresholds.\n\nSpring 2029 — 15 credits (finalize graduation requirements)\n- Remaining upper-level CS elective (3) — to complete required 6+ credits of general CS electives\n- Remaining upper-level elective(s) (9) — to reach 120 total credits and satisfy upper-level credit total\n- JINS 300 (3) — Junior Interdisciplinary Writing-Enhanced seminar (fulfills JINS requirement)\nRationale: Use final semester to ensure you reach ~120 credits, complete remaining upper-level coursework, and take the JINS WE seminar required for graduation.\n\nKey sequencing notes and prerequisites\n- CS 181 and CS 191 (in-progress) unlock CS 260 and CS 310; plan keeps prerequisites satisfied.\n- CS 260 is scheduled before CS 310 and CS 315; MATH sequence continues MATH 263 -> MATH 264.\n- DATA 222 and DATA 324 are placed to satisfy the Data Science minor; CS 430 completes the CS option for the minor.\n- STAT 290 satisfies both Statistics Perspective and the minor's statistics requirement.\n- BIOL 107 (lab science) meets the STEM lab science perspective requirement.\n- ENG 190 and COMM 170 complete the Communication Skills Perspective (writing & speaking).\n- POL 161 (Missouri Statute) is included to satisfy the Missouri Statute requirement (if scheduling adjustments needed, POL 161 can be placed in Fall 2027 or Spring 2028 as long as it is completed before graduation).\n\nGraduation readiness\n- Your audit shows 31 applied credits now; the plan adds ~92 credits across these semesters (including in-progress), bringing you to ~123 total credits which covers the 120-credit minimum and allows for minor/major/upper-level requirements.\n- The plan fills all perspective requirements: Communication (ENG 190 + COMM 170), Social (POL 161 + PSYC 166 + ECON 201), STEM (MATH + BIOL lab), Arts & Humanities (PHRE 186 + ENG 211), Statistics (STAT 290), Interconnecting (JINS 300), and First Year Seminar (TRU 120).\n- Capstone requirements (CS 495 and CS 497) are scheduled senior year to complete the BS in Computer Science.\n\nIf you want, I can convert this into an exact term-by-term schedule with room-for-registration details (course credit numbers validated against current offerings) or adjust for preferred electives/career focus (security, systems, AI)."

All selected electives align with your CS major, Data Science minor, distribution needs, and prerequisite sequencing.\n\nSummary of key elective choices (why these were chosen):\n- CS 325 (3): General CS elective that builds on CS 310 material and counts toward the 6+ CS elective credits you need.\n- CS 460 (3): Upper-level CS elective to satisfy major elective and upper-level credit requirements; chosen for advanced algorithms/systems relevance.\n- CS 480 (3): Advanced-topic CS elective (AI/advanced systems) to reach upper-level credit totals and support career focus.\n- CS 420 (3): Systems elective satisfying the required Systems Elective slot.\n- JINS 303 (3): Computers & Natural Language, a WE JINS course that fulfills the JINS Interconnecting Perspectives requirement while complementing CS/Data Science interests.\n- ECON 201 (3): Microeconomics to help meet the Social Perspective distribution across prefixes.\n\nHow these fill prior placeholders and graduation needs:\n- All previously generic “CS elective”, “upper-level elective”, and “free elective” slots have been replaced with specific courses above.\n- These electives help you reach the 40 upper-level credit requirement and the minimum 6 credits in CS electives while supporting the Data Science minor and distribution requirements.\n\nNext steps I recommend:\n- Review this list with your academic advisor to confirm semester availability and that prerequisites will be met given your in-progress courses.\n- If you have a specific career focus (security, AI, data engineering), I can reassign CS 480/CS 460 to particular numbered courses that best match that focus and check prerequisite timing.\n\nIf you want, I will now place each of these electives into specific semesters in your 4-year plan and ensure each semester is 15–17 credits with all prerequisites satisfied."}
