45 major credits total\n- Data Science minor (must do STAT Option as a CS major): STAT 190/290, DATA 222, DATA 324 or 322, MATH 285 or 357, DATA 520 or STAT 520, plus CS 180 and CS 181 already counting in the minor\n\nPlan assumptions\n- You complete all current Spring 2026 courses with passing grades.\n- Foreign language requirement is waived for you (per audit), so we replace language slots with other requirements.\n- We follow the CS BS sample plan sequence and your DegreeWorks catalog, mapping CS 330 in the sample to CS 333 (already in progress).\n\nSemester 1 (Fall 2026) – 15 credits\n- CS 260 (3) – Major core OOP; follows CS 181 this spring\n- CS 291 (3) – Major core Models; follows CS 181 and CS 191 this spring\n- STAT 290 (3) – Statistics Perspective and Data Science minor\n- COMM 170 (3) – Communication Skills Speaking\n- ECON 200 (3) – Social Perspective (prefix 1)\nPrereq check: 200-level/intro and mid-tier sequencing aligns with sample plan; CS 260/291 come after CS 181/191; STAT 290 after MATH 198.\n\nSemester 2 (Spring 2027) – 16 credits\n- CS 310 (3) – Major core Data Structures & Algorithms; after CS 260\n- CS 315 (3) – Major core Internet Programming; after CS 260\n- PHYS 185 (4) – STEM Lab Science (LSSP) and BS Required Support lab\n- ENG 190 (3) – Communication Skills Writing\n- POL 161 (3) – Social Perspective + Missouri Statute (prefix 2)\nPrereq check: 300-level CS after 260;

JINS requires junior standing; DATA 222 after CS 180.\n\nSemester 4 (Spring 2028) – 15 credits\n- CS 345 (3) – Major core WE/Cyberethics\n- CS 390 (3) – Major Systems elective (Operating Systems); after CS 310 and CS 333\n- CS 480 (3) – Major elective WE/Artificial Intelligence; after CS 310 and MATH 263\n- SOAN 190 (3) – Social Perspective (prefix 3; completes 9 credits with ECON and POL)\n- ENG 211 (3) – Arts & Humanities (prefix 1 for A&H)\nPrereq check: CS 390 fits after Systems/Architecture (CS 333) and Data Structures (CS 310); CS 480 after CS 310 and calculus.\n\nSemester 5 (Fall 2028) – 16 credits\n- CS 495 (1) – Major: Senior Seminar\n- DATA 324 (3) – Data Science minor: Data Visualization; after DATA 222\n- DATA 520 (3) – Data Science minor (Data Mining/Multivariate);

500-level DATA 520 follows STAT 290 and Linear Algebra; CS 470 after 310/333.\n\nSemester 6 (Spring 2029) – 15 credits\n- CS 497 (3) – Major Capstone Experience (final term)\n- CS 455 (3) – Major elective: Computer Security Fundamentals; after CS 310\n- COMM 252 (3) – Free elective (additional speaking; useful professionally)\n- ART 203 (3) – Free elective (Fine Arts breadth)\n- HIST 105 (3) – Free elective (additional Social Science depth)\nPrereq check: Capstone in final semester; CS 455 is advanced, built on 300-level core already completed.\n\nHow this satisfies all requirements\n- CS major (≥45 credits): Core CS 260, 291, 310, 315, 333 (IP), 345, 370; Systems elective CS 390; General CS electives: CS 430 and CS 480 meet the ≥6-credit requirement. CS 495 (seminar) and CS 497 (capstone) included. Total major credits exceed 45.\n- Data Science minor (22 credits): CS 180 (4), CS 181 (3), STAT 290 (3), DATA 222 (3), DATA 324 (3), MATH 285 (3), DATA 520 (3) = 22. As a CS major, you complete the STAT Option (MATH 285 + DATA 520). We will not apply DATA 520 toward the CS elective minimum to avoid any potential double-counting concerns.\n- Dialogues/General Education:\n  - Communication Skills: ENG 190 + COMM 170 complete the 6-credit requirement.\n  - Social Perspective: POL 161 (MO Statute) + ECON 200 + SOAN 190 = 9 credits from ≥2 prefixes.\n  - STEM Perspective: MATH 198 and CS 180 already applied; PHYS 185 supplies the required Lab Science (LSSP).\n  - Arts & Humanities: PHRE 186 (IP Spring 2026) + ENG 211 + MUSI 205 = 9 credits across ≥2 prefixes.\n  - Statistics Perspective: STAT 290.\n  - Interconnecting: JINS 309 (WE) + two additional WE courses are satisfied by CS 370 (WE) and CS 345 (WE) (you also have CS 480 (WE) as a bonus WE).\n  - Civics Exam: Still needed—schedule with Assessment & Testing (do this in Year 2).\n- BS Requirements for CS: MATH 263 (in progress) plus one additional course—DATA 222 is planned to fill the BS additional course and is allowed to double count with the minor (per audit note) but not with Dialogues or the CS major.\n- Upper-level credit (≥40): You will exceed 40 with 300/400/500-level courses including CS 333, 310, 315, 345, 370, 390, 430, 480, 470, 455, 495, 497, DATA 324, DATA 520, and JINS 309.\n- Total credits to graduation: Applied 31 + planned 92 = approximately 123, safely above the 120 minimum while keeping every term at 15–16 credits.\n\nPrerequisite verification highlights\n- CS 260/291 scheduled immediately after CS 181/191 (sample plan Sem 3/4 level). Course numbers confirm mid-level progression (200-level) before advanced 300/400.\n- CS 310, 315, 370, 345, 390, 430, 470, 455, 480 follow the logical and sample-plan progression: CS 260/291 → 300-level cores → systems/networks/security/AI (400-level) → capstone (CS 497).\n- Math sequence aligns: MATH 198 (IP) → MATH 263 (IP) → MATH 285 before DATA 520.\n- Data Science sequence: STAT 290 and DATA 222 precede DATA 324 and DATA 520.\n\nAdvising notes and next steps\n- Register early for CS 260, CS 291, and STAT 290 in Fall 2026; these unlock nearly all later CS and Data Science courses.\n- Schedule and pass the Missouri Civics Exam by the end of Year 2.\n- Confirm with the CS/Math advisors that DATA 520 can remain dedicated to the minor and not applied to the CS elective minimum (you already meet CS elective minimum via CS 430 and CS 480).\n- Target internships after completing CS 310/315 (Summer 2027 onward).\n- Keep Writing-Enhanced designations (WE) in mind—your plan has multiple WE courses to satisfy the extra WE requirement.\n\nIf you want me to tailor course choices (e.g., swap PHYS 185 for BIOL 107 or CHEM 120, or choose different A&H/Social options), I can revise the schedule while keeping prerequisites and credit balance intact."}
