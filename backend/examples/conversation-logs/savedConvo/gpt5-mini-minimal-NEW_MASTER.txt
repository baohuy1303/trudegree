The sample plan sequence is the primary guide. All recommended courses below follow that sequence and DegreeWorks requirements (major, minor, perspectives, statistics, capstone).\n\nSemester plan overview (use with your advisor to place these into specific terms — credits per semester should be targeted 15–17):\n\nYear 1 — Completed / In-Progress (Fall 2025 & Spring 2026)\n- TRU 120 (3) — FYS (in-progress)\n- CS 100 (1) — CS seminar (in-progress)\n- CS 180 (4) — Foundations I (in-progress)\n- MATH 198 (5) — Calc I (in-progress)\n- CS 181 (3) — Foundations II (in-progress, Spring)\n- CS 191 (3) — Computing Structures (in-progress, Spring)\n- MATH 263 (4) — Calc II (in-progress, Spring)\n- PHRE 186 (3) — Arts & Humanities (in-progress, Spring)\n(These are already on your audit — continue to completion.)\n\nYear 2 — Semester 3 (after completing CS181/CS191 and MATH263)\n- CS 250 (3) — Systems Programming (sample plan Sem 3)\n- CS 260 (3) — Object-Oriented Programming & Design (sample plan Sem 3)\n- Dialogues / Social Perspective (3) — choose HIST/POL/MUST/other to satisfy Missouri Statute and Social Perspective (ensure two prefixes)\n- Elective or Foreign Language Elementary II (3) — if pursuing language for BS requirement\nTarget credits: 15–16\n\nYear 2 — Semester 4\n- CS 310 (3) — Data Structures & Algorithms (sample plan Sem 4)\n- CS 330 (3) — Computer Architecture (sample plan Sem 4)\n- CS 291 (3) — Models of Computation (sample plan Sem 4)\n- Required Support course (3) — choose MATH 264 or DATA 300-level as DegreeWorks suggests; MATH 264 recommended if needed\n- Dialogues / Perspectives course (3)\nTarget credits: 15\n\nYear 3 — Semester 5\n- CS 315 (3) — Internet Programming (Area A elective)\n- DATA 222 (3) — Fundamentals of Data Science (minor requirement)\n- JINS 3XX (3) — Writing-Enhanced Junior Seminar (DegreeWorks Interconnecting requirement)\n- BS Requirement course (3) — choose an approved course from DegreeWorks options (e.g., DATA/MATH/STAT 300-level)\n- Dialogues / Elective (3)\nTarget credits: 15\n\nYear 3 — Semester 6\n- CS elective (Area A/B/C) — e.g., CS 390 or CS 430 (3)\n- CS 345 (3) — Cyberethics (sample plan Sem 6)\n- STAT 290 (3) — Statistics requirement (sample plan Sem 6; required for minor and perspectives)\n- DATA 324 (3) — Data Visualization for Data Science minor\n- Dialogues / Elective (3)\nTarget credits: 15\n\nYear 4 — Semester 7\n- CS 495 (1) — Senior CS Seminar (sample plan Sem 7; take in senior year)\n- CS elective (3) — CS 370 (Software Engineering) or CS 390/420 depending on prerequisites and interests\n- Elective / BS Requirement (3)\n- Upper-level elective (3) — ensure 300+ credits to meet 40 upper-level credit requirement\n- Dialogues / Elective (3)\nTarget credits: 13–13+ take an extra 2–4 credit elective to reach 15–17 (e.g., research, internship credit, or additional CS elective).\n\nYear 4 — Semester 8\n- CS 497 (Capstone) (3) — Computer Science Capstone Experience (DegreeWorks required)\n- CS electives (3–6) — complete any remaining Area A/B/C electives (e.g., CS 430, CS 390, CS 370) to reach major elective totals\n- Dialogues / Electives to finish Dialogues Curriculum and Arts & Humanities / Social credits (3–6)\nTarget credits: 15–17\n\nDegreeWorks-specific actions to finish degree:\n- Finish required 45 major credits (you currently have 15 applied; you still need ~30). The above CS core + electives fulfill those.\n- Data Science minor: you have CS180/181 applied (7 credits). Add DATA 222, STAT 290, DATA 324 and CS 430 (CS option) to complete the 22-credit minor.\n- STEM Perspective: you currently have 9 of 10 credits (MATH198 and CS180). Add a lab science (e.g., PHYS 195 or CHEM 101 with lab) to satisfy the Lab Science requirement and reach 10 STEM credits.\n- Arts & Humanities: you have PHRE 186 in-progress (3). Add two additional A&H courses from different prefixes (or one 6-credit course from different prefix) to reach 9 credits.\n- Social Perspective: complete 9 credits from at least two prefixes; include the Missouri Statute course (HIST with MO attribute or POL with MO attribute) — do this in Semester 3 or 4.\n- Statistics Perspective: take STAT 290 (counts for both minor and university requirement).\n- Interconnecting Perspectives: complete JINS 3XX (WE Junior Seminar) and two additional Writing-Enhanced courses (can be CS 370, CS 380, CS 480, etc. when offered as WE).\n- Residency: ensure at least 45 credits in residence and last 28 credits in residence; plan to take your senior-year courses in residence at Truman.\n- GPA: raise cumulative and major/minor GPAs to required thresholds (2.0 major; 2.5 minor) — focus on core CS and STAT courses.\n- Civics Exam: schedule and pass prior to graduation (recommended in first or second year).\n\nImportant prerequisites & sequencing checks (already applied when listing above):\n- CS 181 & CS 191 must be completed before CS 250/260/291/310 sequence — your audit shows these in-progress for Spring 2026.\n- MATH 198 → MATH 263 → (MATH 264 or other) sequence is required for support courses and for upper-level math needs.\n- STAT 290 should be scheduled after or concurrently with the required math background (MATH 198/263).\n\nRecommended immediate next-term enrollments (confirm with advisor/registration):\n- CS 250, CS 260 (or CS 250 + one other CS elective depending on summer offerings)\n- CS 310 & CS 330 in the semester after CS 260/250 and CS 191 are complete\n- STAT 290 and DATA 222 in Year 3 spring/fall as scheduled above\n- Plan CS 495 & CS 497 in senior year (Year 4) to meet capstone requirements\n\nFinal next steps (required):\n1) Meet with your CS advisor to lock these courses into the exact terms and confirm offerings/prerequisites.\n2) Register for a Lab Science (LSSP) course to complete the STEM perspective and BS lab requirement (e.g., PHYS 195 or CHEM 101+lab). Add it to Year 2 or Year 3 schedule.\n3) Choose Missouri Statute course (HIST with MO attribute or POL with MO) and another Social Perspective class from a second prefix.\n4) Ensure Dialogues curriculum and Writing-Enhanced requirements are scheduled across remaining semesters.\n5) Monitor credits in residence and upper-level credit totals; adjust electives to reach 40 upper-level credits and 120 total credits.\n\nIf you want, I can now produce the exact 8-semester semester-by-semester schedule with specific courses and credit counts per semester (15–17 credits each), using your in-progress courses as already placed in Semesters 1–2. Tell me whether you prefer the plan to assume Summer classes are used, and whether you want the Data Science minor to follow the CS option (requires CS 430) or the Statistics option (requires MATH 285 and DATA/STAT 520)."}
